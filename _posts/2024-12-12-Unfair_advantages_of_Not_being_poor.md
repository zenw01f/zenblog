# There's more to having money than just owning a fancy car
There's a lot more to not just being out of debt when it comes to having money. In fact this is just not about earning more. There are plenty of people who make 6 figures that are _still_ in debt due to their poor spending and saving habits. Unless you are uber rich (and I mean uber with a Billion or more) those of us who have a healthy amount in retirement do have options. In fact one of those choices are actually options in the stock market. One of the safest options out there is the covered call which I will touch on later. 

## What are some things people out of debt with extra cash can do?
For starters, the first thing should be maxing out your 401K - assuming you are not retired yet. Putting in money tax deferred is always a good thing along wth Dollar Cost Averaging. 

But what else is there? I mentioned the covered call. But there are several other products and choices available:

- Buying bonds
- High yield savings
- Racking up credit card points
- Other options in the stock market
- Buying investment property (real estate)
- Leverage a secondary business for additional cash flow

Most of all what all of these situations calls for is something that people in debt works against them: That is time. Time to wait things out or allow something to provide income via interest. 
What is also needed is a significant portion of cash for leverage or a deposit. 

- Having cash for property
- Meeting minimums for deposits
- Being able to purchase or hold at least 100 shares of stock for options
- Buying a minimum amount for bonds in order to qualify for optimal interest rates
