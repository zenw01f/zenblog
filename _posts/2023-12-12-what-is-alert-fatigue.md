# What is Alert Fatigue?

There's always the unwanted pop-up that happens right when you're typing a password or trying to get something done. We hate it and if most of the time they are warnings as opposed to real issues happening now then we tend to quickly ignore them; especially if they are repetitive.
Alerts can be useful but also a nuisance if too frequent. For those old enough to remember the beleagured version of Windows called Vista those will remember the headaches of constant pop-up confirmations for validation. Microsoft to no avail attempted to fix this with patches but alas the final nail in the coffin was just the release of Windows 7 which was an overhaul of the system itself to improve the user experience.

# User Experience Matters
An alert in itself can be innocuous. However when crafting a software application it takes a keen developer in order to be mindful of the entire experience of an application as a holistic model of how it plays with the rest of your system. If you think of your computer as an orchestra every application can be individual or sections of instruments. Some play well with the conductor (The OS and Desktop) and others can be clumsily written
