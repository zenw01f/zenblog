I've been a proponent of password managers for many years and have constantly been preaching to people that they need to embrace them. Obviously the question of keeping all your eggs in one basket can cause heart palpitations but the alternatives, such as an excel spreadsheet, give others more comfort.

- Secure password vault (Only as secure as your passphrase is!)
- Notification of breached sites where you have an account
- Autogeneration of secure passphrases 
- Integrated 2FA TOTP
- Web browser modules for auto-input and site validation

Although the [LastPass breach](https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/28/23529547/lastpass-vault-breach-disclosure-encryption-cybersecurity-rebuttal) was probably the worst people feared the issue is _not_ with the concept of a password vault in the cloud but rather the execution of the application by the vendor which failed. Until the death of the password comes about there really is no better way to store credentials _that is user friendly_.
