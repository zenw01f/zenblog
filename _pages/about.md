I'm Zenw01f. 25 year veteran in the IT space with 7+ years in Cybersecurity. I love learning about technology and social engineering. The psychology of how the layperson perceives cybersecurity along with the misconceptions of the financial world bring about an intersection of two worlds that have much in common. 
This is space is to showcase my opinions, research and knowledge from my work within financial companies and the cybersecurity realm.
