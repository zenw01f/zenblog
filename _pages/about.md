After a 20+ year stint in the IT space I chose to refocus my career in Cybersecurity. For the past 7+ years I found learning about security within the technology space combined with social engineering as a fascinating and rewarding endeavor. Money has never been my forte but after spending much of my career in the financial sector and having the benefit of close friends who are financially saavy I've drawn many correlations between good cybersecurity and fiscal hygiene. But nevertheless, this is not a blog that teaches about how one achieves personal financial success (there are plenty of those out there) nor is it about how to hack. Instead this site is a platform for my random musings during my journey as a cybersecurity professional as well the learned lessons and observations in finance that I've accumulated over the years.

The articles in this space are strictly my own opinions, research and knowledge derived from my work within financial companies and the cybersecurity realm. Nothing said here reflects my current or past employers opinions or stance on any topic.
